# CCL - Custom Client Launcher

## About
CCL is supposed to be used to update mmorpg client for TrinityCore based servers. 
It is mostly hardcoded for one specific version of this mmorpg (3.3.5a).

## Installation
If you want to use CCL for your own server, follow this installation guide. You need to
set up client side (Launcher itself which will be then distributed to players) and server side
(which has some information about current patches and provides API for updating).

### Serverside

Feel free to use CCL as you want, modify, share, whatever, just keep it free and open.
